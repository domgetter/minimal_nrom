This will create a standalone mapper that will mimic NROM behavior.

Because it is standalone, you will need to hit RESET when you load a rom from the N8 Pro menus that uses this mapper.

Best way to use this is to put the rom and the RBF file this produces into a separate directory,
and use N8 Pro OS v2.15 or later to automatically use this mapper instead of the built-in NROM.
